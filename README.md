# Jaden Rose (git @jadenrose)

## Interests
* UI/UX Design
* Front-end web development
* Back-end web development

## Current Projects
* A couple pro-bono full-stack projects for friends and family to get some experience, I'll upload my projects to this [Git Repo](https://github.com/jadenrose/full-stack-projects) once I get started on development (currently in the design phase)
* Currently working through the [scrimba.com](https://scrimba.com/) front-end career path. I'll upload anything noteworthy to this [Git Repo](https://github.com/jadenrose/scrimba-projects)
* My [portfolio](https://rosewaterdesigns.ca) is coming along nicely. I got the backend development for the contact form completed recently, now I just need to add a bit more content to make it a bit more interesting
* Enrolled at University of Calgary Continuing Education under their certificate of front-end web development *(completed by mid-2022)*

* I'd love to lend a hand on any front-end projects to those who could use my help
